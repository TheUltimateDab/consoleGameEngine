# consoleGameEngine

this is tetris coded completely from scratch. It uses the windows console as the screen buffer.
  It was largely based on Javidx9's follow-along coding videos. However, I adapted his idea of
  console game engine for my own needs and deleted a lot of code that I don't need yet. The naming
  conventions, functions and variables I use are also very different from his code because I
  coded this engine from my own understanding of a game engine.
  
I also reimplemented my tetris using this engine as a demonstration of how to use my engine to create
  a game. This is included in the files of this repository
